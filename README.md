# Data-Analytics---Data-Visualization-and-Demand-Forecasting

This project is for my data analytics module at UCL. 

Analysed 9 large datasets from Dunnhumby to forecast customer demand and answer 3 questions: 
- What is the price elasticity for each product? 
- What is the impact of promotions on units? 
- How do these differ by geographies? 

Used data visualisation techniques and Machine Learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Regression Tree, Neural Network
